# Gogen typing triage

Alice, 2026-10-14; owner: stoker. Analysis of OSG `3ee404ca1260464221f5eba7d86a06a38eabc6c4`; no generator changes in this task.
Recommendation: type the generator, simplify incidental JS, and retain its recursive IR. Do not make abapiti implement the whole OSG host merely because a parser lives beside a broker.
Inputs: abapiti [union plan](https://github.com/oisee/abapiti/blob/6ed0e12230c7e491c32f04775d23f6bdff6a374e/docs/union-abi-plan.md) and [recon JSON](https://github.com/oisee/abapiti/blob/6ed0e12230c7e491c32f04775d23f6bdff6a374e/docs/evidence/union-abi-recon.json), cloned as `.abapiti` at `6ed0e122`. The measured compiler is `6e942068`; measured OSG is `0abbef3f`. **All 51 implementation hashes still match this checkout.**
The four TS files pass the upstream checker; `allowJs: true, checkJs: false` does not type their imported JS. The public pilot has 76 findings (70 roots, six cascades); the full untrapped closure panics. Its 6,692 repair-note records comprise 69 pilot, 11 external declaration, and 6,612 untriaged implementation records. They are neither independent defects nor 6,692 union failures.

## Blocker decisions

G = cheaper OSG change; A = capability abapiti needs for ordinary typed TS. Hours below are engineering estimates, including focused proof, not measurements. Compiler efforts overlap and must not be summed.

| Pilot group | Decision and smallest useful action | OSG effort / estimated pilot reduction | A work still needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recursive aliases / metadata intersections: 31 | **A**; keep literal `k/e/s/c` tags, metadata and recursive payloads | 0 / **0** | Named recursive graph, structural identity, narrowing and payload views: union plan's 2–4 days |
| Callable/import: 22 | **A**, with G for five missing local implementation/import findings; type frontend/emitter contracts and separate naming from emission | 4–8h boundary work plus conversions below / **up to 5**; these already disappear in the measured full closure | Typed callbacks, constructors, imports, `instanceof`, abaplint implementations and Node adapters: 3–8 days initial contracts; complete parser/host execution unestimated |
| `Extract` / indexed access: 6 | **A**; keep checker-resolved subset aliases and map field types | 0 / **0** | Resolve utilities to retained recursive layouts: 1–2 days after union ABI; spelling duplicate interfaces would only hide the requirement |
| Nullable/truthiness: 1 | **G**; constructor `every` predicate returns boolean: `p.optional === true`, default presence, or supplied name neither undefined nor empty | 1h / **1 candidate** | Null/undefined/optional fields, `??`, optional chains remain **A**, 1–2 days initial support; preserve all 11 documented mixed-absence fields |
| Other: 16 | **G**, partly; property `??=` is **A and done** (abapiti #162), so gogen keeps those sites. Map/Set from iterables and spreads of keys/values are **A** (abapiti, after M1); rewriting those gogen sites is optional, only if it unblocks earlier | 4–8h / **7 direct candidates**, up to six dependent cascades; two `canOmit` findings also depend on the nullable fix | Generic Map/Set, arrays, numeric/string operations and filesystem calls remain **A**; 1–3 days for container cases, adapters separate |
| Tag narrowing / shared discriminants: 0 / 0 | **A**; zero visible findings because failed signatures conceal bodies | 0 / **0** | Test recursive guards, shared tags and multi-literal alternatives as part of union ABI |

Pilot G opportunity: roughly **13 direct records**, potentially six cascades, conditional on A dependencies; do not promise 19 net removals. New bodies can expose new failures. The 11 abaplint namespace declarations are an A library boundary issue, outside the 76; annotations cannot supply their executable implementations. abapiti's partial-HIR panic is fixed (abapiti #161): the full raw inventory at `0abbef3f` is now 5,829 blocking findings (2,925 roots) and 4,728 HIR errors in 32 files.

## Every file in the measured closure

Paths are under `tools/`; `g/` means `gogen/`. R = observed full-closure repair records (51 rows sum to 6,681; the other 11 are external declarations). Δ = estimated records a G change could remove, **not a measured net compiler improvement**; ranges are hypotheses from the source, and exclude A dependencies. Do not add Δ to pilot reductions.
`cut1` removes the AMC import edge by moving `parseSamc` unchanged into a typed shared leaf; **14 files / 533 records** leave the generator closure. `cut2` replaces the constant folder's whole-runtime import with a small typed port of its eight scalar helpers; **two files / 900 records** leave. These cuts do not claim those runtime bodies now compile. Cut rows cost 0h individually; their shared PR costs are P1/P2. Keep host and emitted-runtime behavior intact.

Full-closure reductions must be remeasured. The two boundary cuts target 1,433/6,692 records, leaving a historical 5,259-record workload before new leaf diagnostics; new typed helper records will replace some. Other Δ ranges are coarse budgeting aids, not a causal attribution of the 6,612 findings. The 303 `KindIdentifier`, 241 `kids`, 161 spread and 140 dynamic `get` records illustrate why annotations can help but cannot predict net counts.

## Small PR sequence (all proposed, no PRs opened)

Use named interfaces, explicit return types and literal-tag factories (`satisfies` where useful); typed `Map<K,V>` for computed dictionaries. No `any`, double casts through `unknown`, broad index-signature escape hatches, `@ts-ignore`, enums, parameter properties or runtime namespaces. Use `unknown` only at IO boundaries with actual validation. Preserve property presence and insertion order when serializing Maps. Distinguish mutable frontend state from readonly finished IR; today's Program interface does not cover every JS mutation.

1. **P0, proof/contracts (4–8h):** add the byte comparison driver described below; pin direct Node declarations, explicit `types: ["node"]`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, and keep strict/erasable/noEmit. Extract pure naming from `symbols.ts` into `go-symbols.mjs`, pin its JSDoc contract with `tsc`; emitter imports the pure leaf, breaking the symbols/emitter runtime cycle. Shared helper contracts use type-only imports. Make the TS check required once this baseline is green; extend tsconfig's explicit include list with every converted/shared TS leaf in its PR.
2. **P1, SAMC boundary (4–6h):** new `tools/osd-samc.mjs` pure parser with a checked JSDoc contract, re-export from `osd-amc.mjs`, redirect frontend analysis. Keep absent fields/authority filtering exactly. This is the cheapest cut; add focused parser equivalence coverage and preview proof because the host also consumes it.
3. **P2, scalar folding boundary (8–16h):** new typed folding-only scalar leaf; port NegI, ParseF, ParseI, CFit, S2D, S2T, CToN, IToN plus their private dependencies. Keep `js/abap.mjs`, `js/pcre.mjs` and copied runtime bytes unchanged; differential tests against those functions cover overflow, whitespace, Unicode, negative zero and exceptions. The small deliberate duplication needs parity tests to prevent drift.
4. **P3, six leaf files:** append; diagnostics + literals; source-key + hierarchy; boolx. One semicolon-separated slice per PR, ~2–8h each. Type callbacks against shared contracts; preserve WeakMap key identity and source ordering.
5. **P4, emitter leaves:** packedint before owned; local-constants + builtins; bytes + int8; exception; table-move; sink-locals. Each slice ≤2 files (~2–12h). Share an exhaustive typed child visitor with ownership analysis; preserve its old traversal order and exclusions.
6. **P5, shared SQL:** sqlscript-ir, then sqlscript-lower, then ir-writes, then ir-ranges, then narrow-submit (five PRs, ~3–20h each). These are real generator dependencies and shared Node/preview code: update consumers and run SQL pair/conformance suites as well as gogen proof.
7. **P6, frontend leaves:** analysis; owned; static; builtins; bytes; local-constants (six PRs, ~3–8h each). Finish `.mjs` → `.ts` only after runtime dependencies have moved or been cut; helper interfaces avoid importing frontend values.
8. **P7, cache (three PRs, ~34–56h total):** typed replay accessors/effects first, session snapshots next, object-cache last. Replace Proxy instrumentation with explicit typed reads/writes across frontend; preserve ordered read validation, nested-mutation rejection, fallback, default-off allocation behavior and fresh-process reuse. This is a semantic refactor with a proof gate, not an annotation-only rename.
9. **P8, frontend (6–10 PRs, ~64–112h total):** type loader/options/state first; extract/types/signatures, literals/conversions, expressions/calls, conditions, statements/SQL in successive cohesive slices, then rename the remaining driver. Hoist Unsupported and omitted-constructor contracts into typed leaves to remove the constructor/frontend back-edge; finish `emit-constructors.ts` without a fake callable cast. Do not leave half-typed exported boundaries.
10. **P9, emitter (3–5 PRs, ~24–40h plus symbols):** typed rendering context and type/place routines, expression groups, statement groups, then `.ts` entry and symbols' direct typed call; delete its `as unknown as` shim. Preserve module-state reset, helper registration and deterministic output order.
11. **P10, callers (2–4 PRs, 8–16h, beyond the measured 51):** type `osg-build.mjs` and `osabap.mjs`, then remaining closure/build drivers as separately measured. Preserve public CLI `.mjs` launchers where paths are contracts; wrappers call typed `main()` explicitly. CLI tests, host dispatch and cache invalidation travel with each rename.

Budget: roughly **5–9 engineer-weeks** for the chosen generator work, plus abapiti ABI/adapters and review; re-estimate after P3/P5. P1/P2 and P3/P4 are useful independently. Stop using raw diagnostic-count decline as the acceptance criterion: checker success, byte equality and executed semantics are the gates.

## Proof commands and CI

Existing goldens are semantic: `semantics.mjs`'s EXPECT over `testdata/` (both Go and IR-JS), `test/fixtures/ir-pairs`, unit fixtures and named emitted-source assertions. `frontend-object-cache.test.mjs` explicitly checks cold/warm/fresh-process `emitGo` byte equality; replay/portable tests exercise invalidation and oversized/corrupt data. **There is no complete parent-versus-candidate raw-output golden today.** P0 must add `tools/gogen/typing-proof.mjs` before conversion, covering the semantics corpus, constructor defaults, local constants, layered emission, refusal lists and cold/warm/fresh-process cache paths.
The new driver records raw `emitGo`/`emitJs` strings, stable-build `writeSymbols(..., "typing-proof")` JSON and copied runtime bytes, then compares exact bytes before formatting. Run base and candidate in the same checkout with identical relative fixtures, toolchain, options and environment; capture each PR's parent before editing. Do not normalize generated code, diagnostic order, null/absence, paths or numeric text; only supply the same explicit provenance build to both runs. Cache keys and `symbols.json`'s ordinary HEAD provenance intentionally change with source commits, so cache blob identity is not the output contract.

Run focused commands during each slice, the applicable gogen commands before its PR, and raw comparison on **both Node 22 and 24**. `.github/workflows/gogen.yml`: `gogen` runs these suites, Go vet/tests/race/wasm checks; its TS step currently has `continue-on-error: true`. `unit-inventory` is advisory and tolerates reported gaps; `osgo-parity` is manual only. `.github/workflows/tests.yml`'s `osgo-host` builds the gateway and tests a real request; the aggregate `test` and leak `scan` remain required. Retain Go gates exactly as written in gogen.yml; never turn a failure into a skip. A TS conversion touches shipped `tools/`, selecting full packaging by `docs/ci-tests.md`; keep the registered suite groups. New `test/*.mjs` suites go in `test/suites.d/*.json`.
For P5 run `OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=90-99 tools/osd-heavy.sh node tools/sqlscript-conformance.mjs` and `OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=90-99 tools/osd-heavy.sh npx mocha test/sqlscript-ir.mjs test/ir-writes.mjs test/ir-ranges.mjs`. For shared host/packaging changes additionally use `OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=90-99 tools/osd-heavy.sh npm run e2e:preview`, `OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=90-99 tools/osd-heavy.sh node tools/osd-suites.mjs --group packaging`, and `bun scripts/build-binary.mjs build/osd-typing` then `build/osd-typing doctor`; retain CI's seeded binary isolation smoke (`bun scripts/build-binary.mjs --seed build/osd-typing-seeded bun-linux-x64-baseline`, then `node scripts/smoke-binary.mjs build/osd-typing-seeded` on Linux with working namespaces). Full OSGo parity, when warranted: build fetched packs/generation, `node tools/gogen/osgo.mjs`, then `node tools/gogen/parity.mjs --fast --out .local/gogen-typing-parity`, through the heavy wrapper.

## Runtime and migration risks

- **Node:** `.nvmrc` selects 24; CI selects 22; `tools/osd-node-version.mjs` accepts 22.14+ and 24 (other newer majors warn). [Node 22 docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/typescript.html) enable unflagged stripping at **22.18**, while [Node 24](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/typescript.html) supports it by default. Existing TS imports already expose the 22.14–17 gap. P0 must choose explicitly: keep supported 22.14 with `--experimental-strip-types` propagated to child processes, or separately approve/document raising the minimum to 22.18; do not silently narrow support. Test minimum 22.14 with the flag, 22.18 unflagged, and 24. Runtime Node ignores tsconfig; use explicit `.ts` specifiers and `import type`, erasable syntax only. TS under `node_modules` cannot be stripped; VSIX ships `osd/tools`, but an npm distribution would need emitted JS.
- **Bun binary:** `scripts/build-binary.mjs` uses [Bun.build compile](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables) on `bin/osd.mjs` (CI Bun 1.4.2), which can parse erasable TS. No global loader change is needed for static typed leaves. Gogen is checkout tooling: `bin/osd.mjs` dispatches `gogen-unit.mjs` via a computed checkout import and `osabap.mjs` via URL; `tools/osgo-unit.mjs` explicitly rejects a compiled host. Do not claim the binary embeds Go or the generator. Preserve `toolCommand`/GENERATOR aliases, no bundled `import.meta.url` path assumptions; smoke actual binaries and Node bundles after shared-host changes.
- **Webpack preview:** worker entry is `web/preview-worker.mjs`. The existing `previewClosure()` audit reaches **94 present source modules and zero gogen files** here (generated/dependency modules absent locally); IgnorePlugin cuts store/build/test paths. Thus gogen-only TS needs no preview TS loader. Shared AMC/SQL/host dependencies do reach preview; P1's shared TS parser takes a narrow webpack loader built on `node:module` `stripTypeScriptTypes` (Node 22.13+), applied only to the typed leaves the preview reaches, with no new dependencies and no generated JS (stoker, 2026-10-14). The SAMC leaf sits outside `tools/gogen/`, so the loader's include list names it explicitly. Adding `.ts` to `resolve.extensions` alone cannot parse TS. Keep webpack and its classic-worker lowering; verify a fresh preview, not a stale bundle.
- **Path consumers:** `tools/osd-run.mjs` spawns `tools/gogen/osabap.mjs` through `toolCommand`; `tools/osgo-unit.mjs` targets `unit.mjs`; `test/osgo-unit.mjs` spawns unit/unit-js; `test/osgo-exc-previous.mjs` constructs both paths. Gogen's own tests/CI invoke osabap, unit, semantics, run, gateway, osgo and other drivers by `.mjs` path. `test/dsl-report.mjs` reads osabap source. Keep CLI shims or migrate every literal/computed path and source assertion atomically; do not rename drivers merely to reduce file counts.
- **Less visible consumers:** frontend uses `require("./frontend-object-cache.mjs")` only with cacheDir: update to `.ts` while preserving synchronous lazy loading and no top-level await. `copy-js-runtime.mjs` copies only `.mjs`; emitted JS expects `abap.mjs`, so P2 leaves runtime files intact. `frontend-cache.mjs` hashes `.mjs`/Go but **omits `.ts`**: fix its file selection in P0, including shared tools; object-cache identity already hashes both. Migrate size-budget path keys with renames, preserving limits. Keep parser/core identity from the transpiler's own `createRequire`; an unchecked require result is not a typed parser boundary.

Validation of this plan: checked all 51 source hashes/counts/import edges, inspected test assertions and workflow commands, ran the repository's preview-closure audit. No generator, compiler, runtime or dependency code changed; no code suites or byte-equivalence runs claimed. Local Node is 26.9.0; the requested 22/24 matrix remains an implementation gate.

## Where the plan went (2026-10-15)

- Large files are typed **in place with same-line JSDoc** (#752 emit-go, #754 frontend): abapiti lowers JSDoc in `.mjs` exactly like `.ts` (no `@ts-check` needed), line budgets do not move, and stoker's open branches do not conflict on a rename. Small leaves still convert straight to `.ts`.
- Every typing PR runs a **runtime-shape truthfulness audit**: each annotated function is instrumented over the unit fixture and the semantics corpus, and recorded shapes are compared with the annotations until no contradiction is left (174 contradictions in frontend, 244 in emit-go, that spot-check critics had missed).
- `frontend.mjs` is being **split into eight modules** (docs/frontend-split-plan.md); P8 here is superseded by that plan.
- **After the split:** convert the JSDoc-typed modules to plain `.ts`, one module per PR (JSDoc→TS codemod plus rename; byte proof and token proof as for every PR), once stoker's cache cycle is done.
