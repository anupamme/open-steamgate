# Gogen object cache and warm/cold oracle

The disk object cache is opt-in through `compileProgram({cacheDir, ...})`.
It persists portable class IR and an ordered transcript of program-state reads
and effects. The registry still parses and checks normally. The cache retains the
whole-registry version guard: an edit creates a new version and lowers every
selected class. This is a correctness baseline, not selective reuse after edits.
Reverting exactly to an earlier version can reuse that version's entries.

## Step 4a.2: schema-v3 keys in shadow mode

Audit-build refusal resets per compile while provider gaps remain fail-closed; digest misses under audit stay uncached for a later recorded read.

Disk builds now record internal provenance whenever `cacheDir` is set. This is
the explicitly accepted provisional recorder cost, not a claim that the prior
recording-time budget passed. `provenance: false` keeps the global-only path;
expanded public reporting still requires `provenance: true` or
`GOGEN_PROVENANCE=1`. Cache-disabled compilation does not start recording.
Production lookup remains in the existing globally guarded namespace. The v3
namespace supplies predictions only; no class is selectively reused in production.

The implemented formula uses SHA-256 over canonical tagged JSON. Dictionary
keys use code-point sorting; arrays retain their semantic order:

```text
V = H(["gogen-entry-3", sourceIndependentToolIdentity, effectiveConfig])
D(object) = gogen-resolved-artifact-2 digest
D(rawFile) = H(["raw-file", resolver-visible filename, raw source])
Qid = H(["gogen-query-id-3", saved specification])
Q = H(["gogen-query-answer-3", saved specification,
       answer including MISSING, ordered result/provider identities and digests])
G = H(["gogen-replay-guards-3", ordered replay read/measure transcript])

K3 = H(["gogen-entry-key-3", V, {
  owner, name,
  dependencies: sorted [(artifact identity, D(artifact)), ...],
  rawFiles: sorted [(filename, D(rawFile)), ...],
  queries: sorted [(Qid, Q), ...],
  supplied: saved supplied-parameter guard,
  guards: G
}])
```

The owner digest is included in `dependencies`. The closure starts at the
entry's lowering root and follows provider **artifact-building** edges, including
borrowed definition owners discovered in replay fingerprints. It does not follow
another entry's lowering root. Scheduling and final-output rows do not enter the
key. Source-word/SCC keys remain solely on the global production path. V3 tool
identity hashes actual tools, the npm lock and installed core/transpiler builds;
it excludes source-library pins in `libs.lock.json`. Their effective contents
are guarded by the individual artifact digests.

Completeness is recomputed from the shared graph at storage and candidate
evaluation. Every reachable artifact needs a supported digest and every explicit
raw read needs a hash. Every query needs a registered re-evaluator. Any
`unknown-scan`, including untraced-artifact, built-before-recording,
lowering-built-before-recording, retained-registry-edit or config-edit markers,
refuses a key. Nonportable or unrecordable lowerings receive no v3 candidate.
A known scan ending at a first-match winner is supported: its ordered prefix
and `complete: false` early-stop answer are retained.
Candidate reevaluation also rejects an unknown/untraced marker on a current
dependency or current registry-wide artifact observation; a previously complete
stored graph cannot override a recording gap in the current compile.

Candidates live in `cache/v3/V/H(owner,name)/index.json`, outside the global
registry-version directory. An atomic index retains four K3-addressed payloads
per entry. Payloads and shared provenance graphs have SHA-256 checksums; writes
use temporary files and atomic renames. Missing/corrupt/racing files cause a
shadow miss. Incomplete entries retain only the global cache entry.

At the class seam, shadow evaluation discovers stored candidates, recomputes
dependency digests against the fresh current registry, and re-runs the **saved
query specifications**. Supplied and local discovery indexes were rebuilt from
current inputs before this seam; lock queries read current descriptors, and FM
ownership preserves gogen's last-wins or core's first-match policy. Core named
lookups, misses, include parents, implicit pools, aliases and semantic scans have
explicit resolvers. Ordered replay guards and the supplied guard must also
validate against current program state before `wouldReuseV3` can be true.

`program.frontendCounts.shadowV3` reports each class's `wouldReuseV3`,
`actuallyLowered`, completeness and reason (dependency, named query, replay
refusal or unavailable candidate), plus directly timed `recomputeMs`, validation
count and disagreement count. The timer includes candidate IO/checksums,
decompression, stored/current key calculation, query and digest reevaluation and
trial replay. Namespace/tool-identity setup, lowering and emission are outside it.

Set `GOGEN_CACHE_SHADOW_VALIDATE=1` to additionally lower every would-reuse entry
at that same seam into isolated program collections. Validation compares IR,
ordered assign/effect operations and resulting written values byte-for-byte with
the trial replay. A difference throws `SHADOW V3 DISAGREEMENT` outside cache IO
fallback handling. This flag is enabled in the serial gogen workflow cache step.
The normal oracle also requires nonzero validated predictions, preventing a
vacuous zero-disagreement result.

### Fix round: lazy builds during audit and digest probe order

The second critic reproduced a false v3 prediction with a lazy TYPE pool:
`ZZ_T` resolves through `ZIF_TYPES=>TY_X`. After priming and two unrelated
edits, validation built the pool under audit in the production registry. Its
suppressed reads left no pool-to-interface edge. A subsequent interface length
change (5 to 7) predicted reuse and raised `SHADOW V3 DISAGREEMENT`. An early
source-only pool digest also survived the later build, making the saved graph
depend on probe order. The original global production guard was still active.

This fix chooses **identity snapshots and fail-closed markers**, retaining the
production registry rather than introducing a second registry and remapping
program-held definitions/types. The recorder snapshots cached artifact fields
at each check and advances the trusted snapshot only after recorded work.
`SyntaxLogic.run`, candidate iteration and provider linking respect `auditDepth`.
Audit hooks compare identities before/after the call without recording semantic
rows or edges; a changed identity emits `untraced-artifact` on the provider,
even inside another object's lowering. Later cached reads also compare against
the checked snapshot, including objects already checked by `reg.parse()`.

Digest construction now resolves lazy ABAP syntax and DDIC types **under
recording**, in a provider context independent of the probing consumer. The
projection then only reads those built artifacts under audit. The shared digest
table checks cached identities before reusing a digest; the separate first-probe
memo in the key computer is removed. An unbuilt source-only projection can no
longer become a saved resolved digest. The regression compares the entire saved
graph for the same corpus with reversed probe order around a lazy build.

As a conservative guard, a compile in which any audit call builds an artifact
writes **no v3 graph, payload or index**, including entries unrelated to that
artifact. Query re-evaluation that builds anything also refuses the prediction.
The report gives `persistenceRefused: audit-built-artifact`. The validator still
shares the registry, and this guard remains in place for future 4b work.

`frontend-v3-audit.test.mjs` adds six serial workflow regressions. All six fail
on the pre-fix `5639eead`; the supplied critic harness independently reproduces
the C4 disagreement there. After the fix, both validation modes run C1–C4 and
refuse C4 with exactly `dependency:INTF ZIF_TYPES`, without disagreement.
Additional controls require the marker after an audit build and prove that cold
validation and query re-evaluation builds leave all existing v3 files untouched.
The suite is registered in gogen.yml's “Frontend cache validation and replay”
step with `--test-concurrency=1`.

The dedicated controls live in `frontend-v3-shadow.test.mjs` and
`frontend-v3-sensitivity.test.mjs`. The latter uses narrow portable replay seams
so redundant source/definition/program guards cannot conceal the deliberately
omitted dependency, miss, unknown-observation or query-answer contribution.
Its FM ownership fixture is a portable semantic-query seam; ordinary FM caller
lowerings still contain nonportable registry descriptors and remain uncacheable.
The test-only `GOGEN_CACHE_SHADOW_FAULT` values are `drop-dependency:<regex>`,
`ignore-miss`, `unknown-complete` and `ignore-query:<kind>`. Each negative control
primes and evaluates under its fault and requires the cold validator to throw;
normal validation leaves this variable unset. These faults never change the
globally guarded production lookup.

### Step 4a.2 gate results

- The final sequential frontend/cache run passes **267 tests**, zero failures or
  skips, with shadow validation enabled, in **346.0 s**. Types and suite
  registration pass.
- The full oracle uses **300 controls + fixtures + complete pinned
  open-abap-core/ajson**, both line modes: **66 observations / 64 validated
  mutations**, zero byte mismatches, **38,182 cold-validated shadow predictions
  and zero shadow disagreements**, in **995.6 s**. The two pool-constant attempts
  retain their existing documented unsupported/unchanged-refusal classification.
  Each unchanged/revert control actually reuses 579 global entries and lowers
  22; edited observations still use the global production guard.
- The dedicated 300-class corpus predicts exactly **10 lower / 290 reuse** for
  the ten-class chain base edit, **1 / 299** for the isolated edit, and reuse of
  all 300 existing entries after an unrelated addition. The new class is cold.
  Production actually lowers all selected classes after those edits.
- All four named-query additions are rejected: a new supplied redefinition, a
  new interface implementor, a new ENQU replacing a named miss, and a second
  FUGR winning ownership of the same FM. The last is the portable controlled
  seam described above. All **four sensitivity faults** produce a real shadow
  disagreement that the cold validator catches. Current unknown markers,
  missing digests/raw hashes, bounded variants, corruption and opt-out controls
  pass too.
- Changed-path size budget (`--changed origin/main`) and changed-file leak scan
  exit zero; the inherited, untouched `go:charsearch` breach is reported
  separately by the budget tool. `frontend.mjs` is unchanged.
- Typing-proof against the pre-edit **`f3e7f76d`** record passes **239
  byte-identical artifacts in each of six modes** (sink 0/1, no cache/cold/warm),
  without normalization. Each production warm run still reuses 336 classes and
  lowers 25.

Three fresh Node 26.9.0 warm processes per scenario, each following an
independent cold prime, on the complete pinned open-abap-core + ajson trees.
All 257 real global classes are selected; their local classes bring the total
to **272 class entries**. RAM scratch and the shared Go build cache use the paths
in the commands above. Medians:

| Scenario | Would reuse v3 | Would lower/fall back | Actually lowered | Key checking |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Unchanged | 251 | 21 | 21 | 1,950.8 ms |
| Leaf-class edit | 234 | 38 | 272 | 1,855.9 ms |
| Widely-used interface edit | 231 | 41 | 272 | 1,915.1 ms |

The leaf edit inserts a method comment in `CL_ABAP_HMAC`, which has no incoming
references in compiled source (its Unit tests are excluded). Recorded semantic
closures conservatively include it in 17 cacheable entries, so this is not a
one-entry real-corpus prediction. The interface edit changes
`IF_IXML_NODE=>CO_NODE_TEXT` from 16 to 17 and affects 20 cacheable entries.
The 21 unchanged fallbacks have nonportable or unrecordable lowerings; they are
reported individually in the JSON. All nine warm outputs equal their fresh cold
outputs, with zero disagreements. The frontend medians including cold shadow
validation are 4,788.3 / 5,602.0 / 5,572.0 ms; these are shadow-run costs, not a
selective-production speedup.

Shared query specifications/answers and their hashes, raw-file hashes and
built current artifact digests are memoized per compile with identity checks.
An earlier pre-fix, pre-memoization run spent about 4.8 s checking unchanged
candidates; those historical timings are not mixed into these fix-round
three-process medians. The original recorder-time
acceptance budget remains unmet; the user explicitly accepted its cacheDir-only
cost provisionally for this step.

The critic separately measured a warm key check of approximately **1.43 s**
against only **0.228 s saved by global warm reuse**, across 272 entries. This is
recorded as a cost finding, without optimization in this fix. Step 4b must not
claim a speed improvement until key checking is made cheap and its total cost
is measured against the saving. The existing recorder-time budget also remains
unmet.

Local fix-round evidence: `.local/step4a2-fix-before-final.log` (six failures on
`5639eead`), `.local/step4a2-harness-before.log`,
`.local/step4a2-harness-after.log` (both validation modes),
`.local/step4a2-fix-frontend-final.log`, `.local/step4a2-fix-v3.log`,
`.local/step4a2-fix-oracle.json`, `.local/step4a2-fix-real-predictions.json`,
`.local/step4a2-fix-typing-final.log`, `.local/step4a2-fix-size.log` and
`.local/step4a2-fix-leak.log`. Drivers remove corpus copies and cache scratch in
`finally`; no shared library checkout is edited.

Step 4b (flagged selective production lookup) and Step 4c (default selective
lookup and its performance acceptance gates) remain future work.

## Keys today

The version hashes the cache schema, effective abaplint config, actual tool
contents, lockfiles, installed transpiler/core builds, and the registry's ordered
object inventory and source hashes. Tool identity hashes every
`tools/**/*.{mjs,ts,cjs,json}` file, including nested directories a future
frontend import might use. A fresh-process measurement took 65 ms on this
workstation; the result is memoized within the process. It excludes Git HEAD
and Git tree hashes: a docs-only commit preserves identity; changing tool contents changes it.
Lockfile changes still invalidate globally in this step.

Each object's hash includes its filenames and raw contents **in registry input
order**. abaplint macro collection uses that order and keeps the first definition.
Sorting filenames at this point hid semantic changes even from the global guard.
Folder compilation already sorts its directory walk; supplied registries can
have a different order and are tested explicitly.

Within a version, a class key also includes its source-word dependency closure
(with cycles grouped), lowering-time `getObject` reads, and missing lookup results.
Replay validates program-state inputs atomically before applying effects.
Whole-selection readers have closure variants; supplied parameters are guarded.
Nonportable graphs, nested mutations, corrupt entries and unavailable caches fall
back to lowering. Final interfaces, RTTI, tables and other metadata are rebuilt.
Neither source words nor lowering-time reads cover every semantic dependency.


## Step 4a.1: scoped queries and registry freshness

At the Step 4a.1 snapshot, query scoping and registry rebuilding were implemented
but **did not pass the recording-time acceptance budget**; recording remained
opt-in. The global version guard, source-word/SCC keys and replay validation
stayed in force. That step implemented no v3 lookup, selective reuse, shadow
key or cache-default change. The Step 4a.2 section above supersedes its recording
default and adds observational keys.

`provenanceOf(program)` reports artifact dependencies. The separate
`compilationProvenanceOf(program)` returns `{scheduling, finalOutput}` query
arrays. Artifact-building rows/edges and entry-lowering rows/edges have separate
roots. Reading a cached provider inherits its artifact-building provenance,
including transitive DDIC reads, without inheriting whichever other class's
lowering happened first. Public closure expansion remains an inspection operation.

| Former scan site | Explicit contract and attribution |
| --- | --- |
| Supplied parameters | A fresh contribution index of selected implementations; consumers query `supplied(declaringOwner, method)`. Empty parameter answers remain queries with selected candidate providers. Redefinitions resolve to the original declaring class; interface implementations to the interface; expanded macro statements participate. The replayed `supplied` reads still guard the parameter set. |
| Local definitions/interfaces | `locals(owner, includeTests)` belongs to the discovering owner. Results retain ordered qualified names and definition-owner identities; the shared graph stores their owner digests. The outer dispatch is scheduling. |
| Group/class selection | Ordered `selected-groups` / `selected-classes` scheduling inventories. Class entries retain their actual replay-tracked `wanted` reads. Literal and expanded FM callers receive named ownership answers; gogen's index preserves last-wins enumeration, while core's semantic resolver retains first-match behavior. |
| Locks before lowering | Descriptors build inside ENQU artifact contexts. Consumers query `lock(name)`, including `MISSING`, with ordered keys/fields and ENQU → TABL → DDIC edges. Discovery inventory is scheduling. |
| Locks after lowering | Separate final-output inventory, rebuilt every compile, outside cached class dependencies. |
| RTTI | Final-output inventory and per-owner type projections, rebuilt every compile; emitted bytes remain part of the oracle. |
| Tables/views | Final-output table/view inventory; typing and row projection reads belong to each table/view artifact. SQL consumers retain their independent DDIC dependencies. |
| Ownership | `ownershipSafety(owner)` records the owner's expanded statements and resulting safety projection. Source analysis is rebuilt or reused only with unchanged registry inputs. Cross-class IR ownership analysis still runs outside cached class IR. |

Core's global-definition dispatch is scheduling. Its per-object update/resolution
reads remain artifact dependencies. The INCLUDE candidate dispatch likewise
schedules work; named parent/macro resolution remains attributed to its consumer.
Unclassified scans still appear in `unknownScans` and remain globally guarded.

Bookkeeping exclusions are explicit, audited purposes at named calls, with a
local comment explaining why they perform no semantic resolution: session
prepare/finalize, ordered input/cache inventories, digest inventories, and the
recorder's final artifact-identity snapshot. Metadata assembly walks the shared
recorded graph instead of querying registry inventories. There is no filename
whitelist exempting frontend modules. A later unclassified iteration from the
same module still records an unknown scan.

### Requirements for Step 4 selective validation

Dependency digests alone cannot invalidate every named query. Step 4 must save
query specifications and re-evaluate them against the new registry, including
negative and empty answers. In particular:

- `supplied(ZBASE, WORK)` can answer `[]` with providers `[ZBASE, ZCHILD]`;
  adding a redefinition that tests `IS SUPPLIED` changes that answer.
- A new interface implementor changes the implementor query's candidate set.
- Adding an ENQU changes `lock(EZLOCK)` from `MISSING` to a descriptor.
- Adding a second FUGR with the same FM changes `function-module-owner` under
  its last-wins enumeration rule.

The newly added provider has no prior dependency digest to compare. Re-running
the saved named query is required to discover the changed answer.

Selection-dependent IR also requires replay validation for **complete** entries.
The replay transcript's `wanted` reads guard not-compiled stubs; the supplied
answer guards contributions from selected classes. Step 4 must evaluate
`supplied` against the current selection and retain those replay checks even
when all recorded dependency digests match.

### Fresh-registry contract

A lightweight parse-boundary observer remembers ordered effective inputs and
config. `compileProgram({registry})` compares current sources, object/file
inventory, file order, dependency roles and effective configuration against that
boundary. A source/config/inventory/order edit rebuilds a new registry from the
ordered effective inputs, with the same dependency roles and effective config,
and clears retained session analyses before syntax/lowering. Re-parsing an
edited old registry does not certify its cached consumers as fresh. A prebuilt
registry without an observed boundary is rebuilt conservatively. The first
observed parse also remains untrusted if artifacts already existed at entry;
it cannot certify caches built before the frontend was imported. Folder mode
already constructs a new registry.

Unchanged supplied-registry/Unit/lexer closure rounds keep the same registry and
session lowerings. Subsequent calls with the original supplied-registry handle
reuse its replacement until the original effective inputs change again. Core
synthesized files at compile completion become part of the completed boundary.
The provider `TYPE i` → `TYPE int8` regression now resolves the retained
consumer as **Integer8Type**, including when the caller reparses the old
registry before compiling and when a session retains diagnostics/lowerings.

### Compact storage and its remaining cost

One ordered input snapshot is shared by freshness, tracing, cache inventories
and digest ownership/raw hashes. Named rows are deduplicated before allocating
repeated row objects; immutable artifact identities are memoized. Audited
repository dispatches use explicit enumeration APIs. External core scan adapters
still inspect direct call sites and preserve candidate order and early stopping.

Recorded portable lowerings are compacted/validated and serialized **once** at
the lowering seam. Final guards wrap those immutable bytes. A checksummed,
content-addressed `.provenance` graph stores own artifact/lowering rows, edges
and owner digests once per cache version/observation; entry metadata references
its root using `gogen-dependency-digests-2`. No expanded dependency dictionaries
are stored per class. Cache reads verify and hydrate that graph; the digest CLI
expands dictionaries and recomputes completeness only for inspection. The graph
reference is observational metadata, never a lookup key. Missing/corrupt graphs
fall back to lowering. Recording-off entries retain the old data shape and no
provenance metadata.

### First-observed-parse fix round

The dynamic-import regression builds and syntax-checks `ZIF_PROVIDER`,
`ZIF_CONSUMER` and `ZREADER` before importing the frontend, then changes only
provider `TYPE i` to `int8`, reparses and compiles the supplied registry. It
fails without the fix: `RUN` retains `i` while fresh cold produces `int8` and a
numeric conversion. With the fix the registry is rebuilt and the complete
method IR equals fresh cold. The entry artifact check uses the existing input
snapshot; it adds no snapshot work.

Validation: all **240 frontend tests** pass in an isolated serial run (213 s),
including all **20 query/freshness tests**. Both default and
`GOGEN_PROVENANCE=1` CI-sized oracle runs pass **seven tests**, each with
**62 observations / 60 validated mutations and zero mismatches**. Typing-proof
against a new record from **`06bda3ab`** passes **239 byte-identical artifacts in
each of six modes**; warm runs reuse 336 classes and lower 25. The initial
parallel frontend run had one cache-control failure while other tests generated
tool files; that control passes in isolation and in the full serial run.
Changed-path size budget, explicit changed-file leak scan, suite registration
and whitespace checks pass. The recording-time acceptance budget above remains
**unmet**; this fix does not change that result.

Recording-off recheck: five fresh-process samples per scenario/version, pinned
CPUs 2–3, alternating version order, complete pinned open-abap-core + ajson.
Frontend timing includes input loading through cache finalization; emission and
digest inspection follow the timer. Medians in milliseconds:

| Scenario | `06bda3ab` | Pre-fix `8c5707ec` | Fixed | Fix vs pre-fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No cache | 1,697.4 | 1,758.5 | 1,735.1 | −1.3% |
| cacheDir cold | 2,293.3 | 2,207.3 | 2,267.0 | +2.7% |
| cacheDir warm | 1,891.2 | 1,941.7 | 1,994.4 | +2.7% |

The fix stays within ±3% of pre-fix HEAD in all three scenarios. Relative to
Step 3 this batch is +2.2% / −1.1% / +5.5%; timings have large outliers (including
a 3,806.9 ms fixed warm sample), so it does not establish a ±3% warm-path bound
against Step 3. All **45 captures** have identical emitted-artifact/class-IR and
resolved-digest hashes. Reports remain local in `.local/s4a1-fix-perf.json`.

A focused follow-up uses seven fresh warm samples per version, each after a
fresh cold prime, alternating Step 3/fixed order on pinned CPU 14. Warm medians
are **2,532.0 / 2,557.4 ms (+1.0%)** against `06bda3ab`, within ±3%. All 28
cold/warm captures have identical artifact/class-IR and resolved-digest hashes.
This separate batch addresses the noisy warm-path comparison without discarding
the first batch; `.local/s4a1-fix-warm.json` retains its measurements.

### Step 4a.1 validation and acceptance result

The ordinary artifact manifests have **zero remaining `unknownScans`** on all
651 pinned open-abap-core + ajson objects and all 344 objects of the 300-control
oracle corpus, in recorded uncached/cold/warm runs. There are no residual sites
to list for these corpora. Deliberately unknown loops and unobserved/untraced
artifacts still produce markers in their negative tests. Prebuilt registries
whose parsing predates observation can require a conservative rebuild; unchanged
registries first compiled without recording retain explicit recording-gap markers
when recording is later enabled.

- The complete frontend command passes **238 tests**, zero failures/skips, on
  an isolated final source snapshot; the final query/freshness recheck passes
  **19 tests**, including the additional prebuilt procedural-registry case.
- Default and `GOGEN_PROVENANCE=1` CI-sized oracle commands each pass all **seven
  tests**: **62 observations / 60 validated mutations, zero mismatches**, both
  line modes. The no-version negative controls retain their expected mismatches.
- The full 27-kind sensitivity matrix is unchanged: **14 covered rows / 28
  expected mismatches**, with **13 documented coverage limits**.
- Typing-proof against the pre-edit `5f92e082` record passes **239 raw artifacts
  in each of six modes**, without normalization. Warm processes reuse 336
  classes and lower 25 in both sink modes. The final exact-source recheck agrees.
- The hook sweep kills **40 of 48** mutations. Six getters retain documented
  alternative provider edges; the two retained-edit marker mutations are
  defensive fallbacks superseded by fresh-registry rebuilding. Every survivor
  has an explicit reason; unknown-scan and recording-gap controls are killed.
- Changed-path size budget (`--changed origin/main`), suite registration,
  whitespace and the staged-file leak scan exit zero. `frontend.mjs` is **7,047
  lines**, below its unchanged 7,055-line budget. The unrelated `go:charsearch`
  main-branch breach is still reported separately, not waived for this change.

Three fresh Node 26.9.0 processes per scenario/setting, medians, complete
pinned open-abap-core + ajson, all real classes selected. The Step 3 reference is
an isolated source copy of `5f92e082` with recording off. Both runs use RAM
scratch and the shared Go build cache; loading, normalization, parse, syntax,
lowering/replay and cache finalization are timed. Emission, public manifest
expansion and full diagnostic digest inspection occur after the frontend timer.

| Scenario | Step 3, recording off | Candidate, recording on | Added cost | Budget | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No cache | 1,562.7 ms | 1,928.8 ms | +23.4% | +5% | FAIL |
| cacheDir cold | 2,038.0 ms | 2,686.1 ms | +31.8% | +25% | FAIL |
| cacheDir warm | 1,721.1 ms | 2,114.7 ms | +22.9% | +10% | FAIL |
| Cache file bytes | 531,433 | 812,536 | 1.529x | 1.500x | FAIL |

Candidate recording-off medians are 1,625.6 / 2,018.6 / 1,769.6 ms
(no-cache/cold/warm). All **36** reference/candidate captures share identical
emitted-artifact/class-IR and fully inspected resolved-digest hashes. Cold and
uncached runs lower 272 classes; warm runs reuse 251 and lower 21, with zero
diagnostics. Recording storage is down from the Step 3 recorded 6,550,282 bytes
to 812,536 bytes, but still exceeds the requested recording-off baseline budget.

The focused CPU profiles start after module imports and stop immediately after
compilation, before emission and public inspection. They are sampling diagnostics,
not additional acceptance timing runs. Query recording/hooks/indexes account for
167 ms of uncached self samples and 192 ms cold; ordered snapshots account for
25 / 38 ms. Cold digest projection contributes 258 ms of self samples, and
cache/replay/serialization 209 ms. GC contributes 94 / 123 ms. The rest is chiefly
parser, syntax and lowering work; profiler overhead is reported separately.

The recording-time gate remains **FAIL**. Further work needs a cheaper observation
path (for example, core artifact/resolver callbacks plus interned query/owner IDs)
and cheaper input-snapshot comparison; another closure-format-only change cannot
remove all measured hook/index/digest costs. Two options remain: keep this
foundation opt-in for review, or continue a dedicated Step 4a.1 recording-cost
follow-up before starting 4a.2. Neither option permits weakening completeness
checks or enabling selective/default lookup on this branch.

Local reports: `.local/step4a1-perf-base-recheck.json`,
`.local/step4a1-perf-measured.json`, `.local/step4a1-budget.json`,
`.local/step4a1-oracle-inventory.json`,
`.local/step4a1-profile-summary.json`, `.local/step4a1-compile-{none,cold}.cpuprofile`,
`.local/step4a1-sensitivity.json`, and `.local/step4a1-hook-sensitivity.json`.

### Recorder-cost follow-up: acceptance remains unmet

The recorder follow-up on `perf/gogen-cache-recorder` retains opt-in recording.
It improves storage, but the final paired timing batch still fails the default-on
budget. No default-recording or selective-lookup change is enabled.

The implemented changes intern repeated `getObject` tuples per owner/phase
before allocating normalized arguments, result arrays and public query keys.
The pinned core's pure `getABAPFiles` and class/interface `getDefinition`
getters retain provider edges and recording-gap checks without an artifact
frame. Other artifact adapters open/close frames directly, avoiding a callback
allocation per invocation. Retained input comparisons use ordered filename/raw
pairs instead of serializing both inventories; identical snapshots can be
shared across recorder hooks. The shared provenance graph uses deflate level 4;
entry payloads and the recording-off serialization path retain level 1.
Existing immutable lowering bytes and shared graph storage are preserved.

Three fresh Node 26.9.0 processes per version/setting/scenario, complete pinned
open-abap-core + ajson, alternating version and recording order, pinned CPU 14,
RAM scratch and the shared Go build cache. The reference is the unchanged
`67358147` source snapshot. Each version's recording-on times are compared with
**that same version's recording-off** times. Loading/normalization, parse, syntax,
lowering/replay and cache finalization are timed; emission, public manifest
expansion and full diagnostic digest inspection follow the timer. Values are
medians in milliseconds; OFF / ON columns show the two settings.

| Scenario | Before OFF / ON | Before overhead | After OFF / ON | After overhead | Budget | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uncached | 2,317.4 / 2,684.5 | +15.8% | 2,338.2 / 2,671.1 | +14.2% | +5% | FAIL |
| cacheDir cold | 2,768.9 / 3,513.3 | +26.9% | 2,787.5 / 3,511.8 | +26.0% | +25% | FAIL |
| cacheDir warm | 2,513.8 / 2,839.1 | +12.9% | 2,510.7 / 2,855.7 | +13.7% | +10% | FAIL |
| Cache file bytes | 531,454 / 812,261 | 1.528x | 531,451 / 787,320 | 1.481x | 1.500x | PASS |

Recording-off changes against the reference are **+0.9% / +0.7% / -0.1%**
(uncached/cold/warm), within the requested ±3%. All **36 captures** have identical
emitted-artifact/class-IR and resolved-digest hashes. Uncached/cold runs lower
272 classes; warm runs reuse 251 and lower 21, with zero diagnostics. Earlier
exploratory batches are retained locally; this isolated paired batch is the
acceptance result. The historical Step 3 comparison above is a different baseline.

Correctness gates:

- **249 tests pass**, zero failures/skips, in the serial combined frontend/cache/
  oracle command, including provenance, digests, freshness and both new canonical
  comparison tests.
- Default and `GOGEN_PROVENANCE=1` CI-sized oracles each pass all **seven tests**,
  **62 observations / 60 validated mutations / zero mismatches**, both line modes.
  Their no-version negative controls retain the expected mismatches.
- The unchanged hook sweep kills **40 of 48** mutations, with the same eight
  documented survivors as the parent branch.
- The new `frontend-provenance-compare.mjs` compares all **344 oracle-corpus**
  and **651 pinned-library** artifact manifests plus scheduling/final-output
  manifests against the parent in uncached/cold/warm processes. All match,
  together with raw emitted output and resolved digests. Query dictionaries and
  row properties are canonicalized; ordered results/providers/arguments, phase,
  policy, early stopping, misses, unknown markers and duplicate rows are retained.
- Changed-path size budget (`--changed origin/main`), suite registration,
  whitespace and the explicit changed-file/staged-file leak scans pass. The
  inherited `go:charsearch` breach remains reported separately.

The focused profiles start after imports and stop before emission or public
inspection. After-change self samples total about **186 / 209 ms** in query
recording/hooks/indexes and **32 / 36 ms** in ordered snapshots (uncached/cold).
Cold resolved projection/hashing contributes **379 ms**, and cache/replay/
serialization **215 ms**. GC contributes **256 / 287 ms**; these are whole-compile
GC totals, not an estimate of recording-only GC. Profiler overhead is separate.
The uncached diagnostic run sees about 49,000 named lookups but constructs
normalized query inputs for only about 7,900 of them; intern-table work and
other hooks consume much of the saving. The wall-time budget therefore remains
**FAIL**.

Next options are a core observer seam that reports resolver/artifact events
without per-getter wrappers (while retaining cached-provider edges and unknown
iteration detection), and compact interned query/owner/phase IDs for all query
kinds. Cheaper resolved-digest projection could reduce cold cost, but cannot
repair the uncached gate, which performs no digest work. Keep this foundation
opt-in until a callback-based path meets all budgets; Step 4c remains blocked.

Run the comparator through the established heavy-run wrapper. Record the parent,
then compare the candidate; repeat both commands with `--real`:

```sh
node tools/gogen/frontend-provenance-compare.mjs --compiler <parent-checkout> \
  --report .local/manifests-before.json
node tools/gogen/frontend-provenance-compare.mjs \
  --compare .local/manifests-before.json
```

Reports remain local in `.local/recorder-paired.json`,
`.local/recorder-profile-summary.json`, `.local/recorder-profile-{before,after}-{none,cold}.cpuprofile`,
`.local/manifests-{base,candidate}-{oracle,real}.json`, and
`.local/recorder-hook-sensitivity.json`. Disposable compiler copies and cache
scratch are removed after validation.

## Resolved-artifact digests (step 3)

A cache/session compilation installs an empty digest memo after syntax checking.
The ordered replay seam requests a `gogen-resolved-artifact-2` SHA-256 digest
only when fingerprinting a read that contains a definition; repeated reads reuse
that owner's digest. Unread owners are never projected on the normal compile path.
Without cacheDir or a recording session, compilation does no digest work.
Explicit inspection (`artifactDigestsOf` / the digest CLI) requests a full
snapshot after compilation; diagnostic dependency metadata requests its hit
owners separately when provenance recording is enabled. `frontend-artifact-digests.mjs` owns the projections
and stores them in a registry-keyed weak table; no digest fields enter IR or
replay-tracked program state. A new table replaces the previous compile's memo.

The digest hashes canonical JSON tuples containing the uppercase `TYPE NAME`,
ordered effective files (portable filenames, raw-source hashes), expanded
syntax tree shapes and token text/positions (including macro virtual positions),
global/local definitions, typed scopes and resolved DDIC types through core's
`parseType(registry)` contract. Definitions include resolved parameter,
attribute, constant and named types, parameter directions/defaults/optional
flags, visibility, aliases, superclass/interfaces/friends, method flags and
events/handler parameters. Scopes include local/inline types, deferred names
and symbolic resolution references. Object-reference types use symbolic
locations rather than recursively importing another definition's graph.

Dictionary keys use code-point sorting; arrays preserve semantic/source order.
Filenames strip directory prefixes. Expanded statements, definitions and
recursively shared types are projected and hashed once within a compile.
Statement hashes include token text and real/virtual positions; structure
projections reuse those hashes instead of repeating token graphs. Source
expressions use their token sequence (including parentheses) so the transpiler's
in-place arithmetic precedence regrouping cannot change a digest according to
whether its owner has been lowered or replayed. This canonicalization is the
format-2 change; the rest of the resolved projection is retained. Parent links, registries,
object identities, parser caches and Map insertion order never enter this
format. The digest is a snapshot of what core actually resolved, including
Unknown/Void types, rather than a claim that resolution succeeded. Unsupported
shapes produce a `null` digest plus an inspection error; definitions belonging
to such an owner decline replay. The global source/version guard remains
unchanged, including for unknown or incomplete provenance.

Replay definition fingerprints now contain location **plus** `{owner, digest}`.
A same-name/file/start definition with changed semantic contents rejects replay
atomically. Repeated reads reuse the owner's digest rather than serializing its
graph. Definitions without a registry/owner digest refuse persistence.

The definition fingerprint is **owner-local**. A DEFAULT naming another object's
constant projects its token text symbolically, as lowering uses it. Inherited
members are represented only by superclass name, and an exception superclass is
also a symbolic edge. These external semantics are covered only by provenance
dependencies: step 4 must key on dependency digests as well as the fingerprint.

Resetting the digest memo alone does not repair retained parser artifacts.
Step 4a.1 now rebuilds edited supplied registries before lowering, repairing the
provider TYPE edit that previously left a consumer at IntegerType instead of
Integer8Type. The historical Step 3 measurements below predate that rule. Core also does not resolve READ-ONLY on DATA attributes: only the tokens
and raw-source hash carry it. Step 6 must account for that resolution boundary.


Recorded disk builds now use the shared `gogen-dependency-digests-2` graph
outlined above; explicit `provenance: false` still overrides the environment.
The historical Step 3 format stored a sorted, expanded `dependencyDigests`
dictionary per entry. Inspection preserves that view by expanding shared graph
roots and recomputing `provenanceComplete`. Both formats are diagnostic metadata,
**outside lookup keys**. Unsupported digests and unknown/untraced observations
remain incomplete. Recorded replay of an entry built with recording off retains
`lowering-built-before-recording`; it does not invent a transcript. Recording-off
entries still persist immediately without provenance metadata. Recorded entries
freeze serialized lowering bytes before finalized graph guards are available.

```sh
# All current artifact digests, or one artifact (no cache needed).
node tools/gogen/frontend-artifact-digests-cli.mjs src --show 'CLAS ZCL_READER'
# Inspect the dependency digests stored for an entry, across retained versions.
node tools/gogen/frontend-artifact-digests-cli.mjs --cache-dir .local/cache --entry ZCL_READER
node --test tools/gogen/frontend-artifact-digests.test.mjs
```

The cross-object gate uses a real global class definition and a separate reader
at the ordered replay/cache seam. The provider's constant changes `1` to `9`
without changing filename, name or start. The reader borrows the pre-resolved
definition through a program map, without source-word or lowering lookup edges.
Under `no-version`, semantic fingerprints give EQUAL in both line modes;
`no-version,fingerprint-location-only` gives MISMATCH on the supplemental
`borrowedDefinitionReplay` artifact. The corpus also contains an ordinary global
constant reader whose Go/JS cold output changes. This controlled seam is
explicitly **not a normal cross-object local-class lowering path**: local
class names are `OWNER:LOCAL`, local interfaces are `OWNER|LOCAL`, and ABAP local
names resolve within their own class pool. No cross-pool local-definition read
has been constructed. The seam isolates the fingerprint invariant that ordinary
global word/getObject guards would otherwise mask.

An eight-interface forward type chain exercises repeated global-definition
passes and its unchanged class reader. A terminal type mutation must change
cold Go/JS. The within-object first-wins macro reorder remains in the oracle.
These gates use fresh registries/processes and compare warm with fresh cold;
they do not implement retained-registry parser invalidation.

### Initial step 3 validation and cost (before the performance round)

The combined sequential frontend/cache/CI-oracle run passes **221 tests**.
The latest digest/CI recheck passes **16 tests**, followed by three focused
checks for snapshot preservation, the cross-object fault, and backward-compatible
`drop:` regular expressions containing commas. All have zero failures/skips.
The CI oracle has **62 observations / 60 validated mutations, zero mismatches**,
with lines on/off. The full 27-kind sensitivity matrix has 14 covered fault
rows / 28 expected mismatches and 13 documented uncovered rows. The strengthened
cross-object control is EQUAL under `no-version` in both line modes. Global type
passes and first-wins macro order are covered; reversing global-definition
candidate insertion preserves per-object digests, and the changed inventory's
warm output matches its own fresh cold output under the retained global guard.

The typing-proof record was captured on `543b1053` before implementation edits.
Comparison passes **239 raw artifacts in each of six modes** (sink 0/1 times
no-cache/cold/warm), with no normalization. Digest stability passes on both the
small oracle corpus and all **651** real-library objects: two fresh processes
per Node 26.9.0 / Bun 1.4.2 and provenance-off/on combination, eight processes per corpus.
The real runs have no unsupported digest shapes. Size budget
`--changed origin/main`, explicit-path leak scan, whitespace and suite-list
checks exit zero; `frontend.mjs` remains **7,055 lines**, zero net growth.

Three fresh-process runs per scenario/reporting setting, medians on Node
26.9.0, pinned open-abap-core + ajson, every real class selected. Both the parent
and candidate use `OSD_HEAVY_TMP=/mnt/ram/stoker`, with the shared Go build cache.
The parent is an isolated source copy of `543b1053`. Digests are always on in
the candidate; disk builds also collect internal provenance. Times include
source loading, normalization, parse, syntax, digest projection, lowering,
replay and final dependency-metadata expansion; emission and public report
inspection are outside the frontend timer. Digest cost includes snapshot setup
and is measured directly, rather than inferred from total-time subtraction.

| Scenario, public reporting off | Parent total | Step 3 total | Digest projection | Total overhead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No cache | 1,448.6 ms | 1,807.0 ms | 413.1 ms | +24.7% |
| cacheDir cold | 1,697.6 ms | 3,344.6 ms | 375.2 ms | +97.0% |
| cacheDir warm | 1,485.5 ms | 2,415.3 ms | 372.4 ms | +62.6% |

With public provenance reporting on, candidate totals are
2,155.9 / 3,399.6 / 2,516.3 ms
(no-cache/cold/warm); direct digest costs are
373.5 / 371.0 / 376.7 ms.
All 18 candidate captures have identical resolved digests and emitted artifacts /
class IR, and their emitted-artifact/IR hash equals all 18 parent captures.
Every warm run reuses 251 classes and lowers 21, matching the parent; there are
272 lowered classes in cold/no-cache runs and zero diagnostics.

Cache file bytes grow from 526,839 to 6,436,245
with public reporting off, and from 694,040 to 6,534,884
with it on. The dependency dictionaries conservatively include registry-level
hits inherited by every manifest, so they are dense. Warm caching remains slower
than cache-disabled compilation on this corpus. These measurements leave the
cost visible for step 4; no selective-reuse or performance-benefit claim follows.
Reports remain local: `.local/digest-perf-parent-ram.json`,
`.local/digest-perf-ram-final.json`, `.local/digest-real-stability.json`, and
`.local/digest-sensitivity-final.json`. Scratch/cache copies are removed; the
pinned library checkouts are unchanged.

### Step 3 performance round

Three fresh Node processes per scenario and recording setting, medians on
Node 26.9.0, complete pinned open-abap-core + ajson, same RAM scratch and shared
Go build cache. Parent `543b1053` was remeasured in an isolated source copy;
"initial step 3" is the preceding round's recorded measurement at `025f26c2`.
The frontend timer includes loading, parsing, syntax, lowering/replay and cache
writes. Full digest inspection and emission occur after the timer. The benchmark
checks all inspection results for completeness/unsupported shapes separately from
its lazy compile counters, and rejects any uncached digest projection.

| Recording off | Parent, remeasured | Initial step 3 | Lazy step 3 | Over parent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No cache | 1,458.8 ms | 1,807.0 ms | 1,427.7 ms | -2.1% |
| cacheDir cold | 1,721.8 ms | 3,344.6 ms | 1,820.5 ms | +5.7% |
| cacheDir warm | 1,535.0 ms | 2,415.3 ms | 1,599.3 ms | +4.2% |
| Cache file bytes | 526,839 | 6,436,245 | 531,461 | 1.009x |

All requested default-path limits pass. Uncached compilation has **zero** digest
projections. Cold and warm each fingerprint **five of 651 owners**, projecting
5,355 shared nodes in 76.2 / 75.7 ms (including the sub-millisecond filename
inventory). Median owner costs are roughly AJSON 31 ms, SXML reader 16–18 ms,
JSON 11–13 ms, ZIP 10 ms and Unit assertions 5 ms. Each owner is projected once
per compile; 1,000 repeated fingerprints reuse its memo. Resetting a retained
registry's compile discards that memo, and an uncached compile removes it.

A fresh cold CPU profile attributes approximately 35% of classified samples to
registry parsing, 16% to syntax checks, 26% to lowering/final metadata, 12% to
disk-cache/replay work, 4% to digests, 4% to GC and 3% to loading. Parser
combinators remain the largest individual parser site. Cache costs include
fingerprint JSON, portable validation, compression and serialization; further
work there is independent of selective cache keys. Profiles are diagnostic
samples rather than additional timing runs.

| Recording on | Total | Added over recording off | Digest projection | Cache bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No cache | 1,793.2 ms | 365.5 ms (+25.6%) | 0 ms | 0 |
| cacheDir cold | 3,458.6 ms | 1,638.0 ms (+90.0%) | 348.0 ms | 6,550,285 |
| cacheDir warm | 2,217.2 ms | 617.9 ms (+38.6%) | 87.3 ms | 6,550,285 |

Provenance diagnostics retain their separate cost: a cold recorded build requests
492 owners through dense dependency-hit metadata. Its profile is dominated by
manifest expansion, metadata assembly, snapshot cloning and serialization/write
work; these operations are absent from ordinary cache writes. A warm recorded
build requests the five fingerprint owners and reuses stored metadata. The
metadata remains conservative, incomplete where unknown scans exist, and outside
the key. Recording is an explicit diagnostic choice.

All 18 candidate captures have identical emitted-artifact/class-IR hashes,
matching all 18 parent captures. Full post-compile digest inspection also agrees
across all 18 candidate runs, including provenance on/off and cold/warm/no-cache.
Every warm run reuses 251 classes and lowers 21; cold/no-cache lower 272, with
zero diagnostics. Arithmetic regrouping has an explicit regression so lazy
snapshots cannot depend on whether lowering has visited their owner.

The complete sequential frontend/cache/CI-oracle check passes **225 tests**, with
zero failures or skips. The obsolete always-record regression now decodes cache
files to assert that recording-off entries have neither transcript nor metadata,
and that recorded replay marks them incomplete; its 25-test suite passes.
The CI oracle has **62 observations / 60 validated mutations, zero mismatches**.
The full sensitivity matrix passes 14 covered rows / 28 expected mismatches,
with 13 documented coverage limits. The cross-object semantic fingerprint
remains EQUAL under `no-version`, while
location-only fingerprints give MISMATCH in both line modes. All **651** real
objects agree across eight fresh Node/Bun processes (two per runtime and
provenance setting). The isolated unedited `543b1053` typing-proof record compares
byte-for-byte: **239 raw artifacts in each of six modes**. Changed-file budgets,
explicit-path leak scan, whitespace and suite registration pass; `frontend.mjs`
remains **7,055 lines**. The budget command also reports the existing unrelated
`go:charsearch` breach on origin/main; no changed path exceeds its budget.

Reports are local: `.local/digest-lazy-parent-perf-final.json`,
`.local/digest-lazy-perf-final.json`, and `.local/digest-lazy-profile-{off,on}.json`.

## Semantic provenance (historical step 2)

`compileProgram({provenance: true, ...})` records semantic resolution before
`reg.parse()`, through global definition passes, syntax checking and lowering.
Recording is **off by default**, including disk builds. Enable it with
`provenance: true` or `GOGEN_PROVENANCE=1`; explicit `provenance: false`
overrides the environment. An explicit enclosing `recordProvenance` session
also enables recording.
Provenance remains observational: it supplies step 3 metadata, without changing
cache keys, source hashes or the whole-registry version guard. Selective
per-entry keys remain step 4.

The facade lives in `frontend-provenance.mjs`; its recorder is loaded synchronously
only for recording or provenance inspection. The implementation lives in
`frontend-provenance-recorder.mjs` and its version-specific
`frontend-provenance-hooks.mjs` adapters. Scoped synchronous hooks restore the
original descriptors in `finally`, including on errors. The frontend's FM
selection walk remains in the facade, with recorder hooks so its index reads
and named ownership queries can be attributed to each consumer. Function-group
signature/lowering work and class lowering have explicit artifact contexts.
`frontend.mjs` shrinks by 20 physical lines.

```js
import {compileProgram} from "./tools/gogen/frontend.mjs";
import {provenanceOf, recordProvenance} from "./tools/gogen/frontend-provenance.mjs";
const program = compileProgram({folders: ["src"], objects: ["ZCL_READER"], provenance: true});
const manifest = provenanceOf(program).get("CLAS ZCL_READER");
// With a supplied registry, wrap its construction/parse too:
recordProvenance(() => { registry.parse(); return compileProgram({registry, folders: [], objects}); });
```

`provenanceOf(program)`, `provenanceOf(session)` and `provenanceOf(registry)`
return a `Map` keyed by uppercase `TYPE NAME`, including non-selected registry
objects. Each value is `{hits: [], misses: [], scans: [], unknownScans: []}`.
A named-query row has `artifact` (the original owner), `phase`, `kind`, `args`
and `result`. An empty result is a miss, rather than an omitted dependency:

```json
{"artifact":"DTEL ZORACLE_NUM","phase":"ddic-type","kind":"getObject",
 "args":["DOMA","ZORACLE_NUM"],"result":["DOMA ZORACLE_NUM"]}
```

Scans additionally have `scan` (`getObjects` or `getObjectsByType`), ordered
visited `result` object keys and `complete`. `complete: false` preserves early
termination at the winning candidate. `queryArgs`, where available, identify
the enclosing semantic query separately from the iterator's arguments.
For example, a `cds-alias` scan has `args: ["DDLS"]` and
`queryArgs: ["ZSQLALIAS"]`. Unknown scans have `kind: "unknown-scan"` and a
short `site` stack. Names used in case-insensitive resolution are normalized
for inspection; filenames in results retain their actual spelling.

The recorder covers named object/file/filename-owner/first-object lookups;
implicit type-pool type and constant prefixes; FUGR module ownership and
includes; CDS definition/SQL-view aliases; include parents and sibling macro
context; ENHS/BAdI scans and BDEF lookups. Recursive `parseType` artifact edges
retain TABL/DTEL/DOMA, TTYP, VIEW, structure INCLUDE and APPEND dependencies.
The FM index preserves gogen's last-wins enumeration, while core's ownership
and alias scans preserve their first-match prefix order.

Artifact reads add edges even when an abaplint getter or `SyntaxLogic.run()`
returns a cached result. Manifests expand these stored edges at inspection
time, inheriting the provider's queries with their original owner/phase.
A second cached TABL consumer therefore still shows the DTEL's DOMA lookup.
The disk IR and memory-session `provenance` field carries only the owner's own rows and edges:
`{rows: [...], edges: ["TYPE NAME", ...]}`. It never persists a transitive query
closure; step 3 separately saves the deduplicated dependency digests. Replay restores these rows/edges, and `provenanceOf()` expands them
against the current registry's provider artifacts on demand. The transcript
still does not participate in cache validation.

Artifact identities (syntax result, parsed type, definition, parsed files and
FM/include metadata) are snapshotted at the end of each recording session.
An artifact subsequently built with recording off gets an `untraced-artifact`
marker on its owner, even when a retained syntax session bypasses checking.
Artifacts first encountered after they were built receive
`artifact-built-before-recording`. Memory/disk replay without an own-row
transcript receives `lowering-built-before-recording`. Disk builds with recording off store no transcript; subsequent recorded replay
marks such entries `lowering-built-before-recording`.

Inventory snapshots copy filenames and SHA-256 content hashes; they do not
retain core's mutable file array. Replacing, adding or removing a file, or
changing registry configuration, prunes old query/edge rows and marks retained
artifacts incomplete (`retained-registry-edit` / `retained-registry-config-edit`).
This does not repair abaplint's caches or implement parser invalidation.

Actual lowering reads of `program.functionModules` add a named
`function-module-owner` query and provider edge, including CALL FUNCTION
expanded from a macro. Unknown scan sites use repo-relative or module-relative
paths (external frames use `<external>/basename`); absent/unrecognised stack
frames remain unknown scans. Folder mode reads `.asddls` for gogen's CDS
metadata but does not register it in core. CDS alias provenance therefore
requires supplied registries containing DDLS files; this limitation is unchanged.

Registry orchestration has no single object owner. Such rows use
`artifact: "<registry>"` and are conservatively included in every object's
manifest. An unclassified iterator remains in `unknownScans`, even if nested
inside a known syntax pass. These manifests **are not evidence that the global
guard can be removed**. A later key implementation must retain the global guard
or decline reuse for every entry with unknown/incomplete provenance.

```sh
node tools/gogen/frontend-provenance-recorder.mjs <folders...> \
  --objects ZCL_READER --show 'CLAS ZCL_READER'
node --test tools/gogen/frontend-provenance.test.mjs
# Run the combined frontend/cache suites sequentially: ownership tests generate
# temporary tools/**/*.mjs, which intentionally enter compiler identity.
node --test --test-concurrency=1 tools/gogen/frontend-*.test.mjs tools/gogen/cache-oracle.test.mjs
GOCACHE=/mnt/ssd-510/osg/go-build TMPDIR=/mnt/ram/stoker \
  OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=50-59 tools/osd-heavy.sh \
  node tools/gogen/frontend-provenance-bench.mjs --rounds 3 \
  --report .local/provenance-300.json
# Pinned complete library trees; every real class is selected, tolerant refusals retained.
GOCACHE=/mnt/ssd-510/osg/go-build TMPDIR=/mnt/ram/stoker \
  OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=50-59 tools/osd-heavy.sh \
  node tools/gogen/frontend-provenance-bench.mjs --real --rounds 3 \
  --report .local/provenance-real.json
```

The focused gates exercise each channel above, named/scan misses, candidate
order and early stopping, cached DDIC inheritance, disk replay inheritance,
unknown scans and exception-safe restoration. On/off comparisons include Go,
JS or its refusal, class IR, diagnostics/refusals/missing members and all final
metadata compared by the cache oracle.

### Fix-round validation and recording cost (historical step 2)

The focused regression gates cover opt-in/environment precedence, own-row disk
storage/replay, recording gaps in syntax/DDIC/memory/disk lowering, immutable
replace/add/remove snapshots and stale-row pruning, configuration edits, empty
stack frames in a child process, portable sites, macro-expanded FM signatures,
and owner isolation for sibling INCLUDE macros. The hook sweep runs one adapter
mutation at a time in a disposable copy and verifies a passing baseline first:

```sh
GOCACHE=/mnt/ssd-510/osg/go-build TMPDIR=/mnt/ram/stoker \
  OSD_HEAVY_RANGE=50-59 tools/osd-heavy.sh \
  node tools/gogen/frontend-provenance-mutations.mjs \
  --report .local/provfix-mutations.json
```

The 48-mutation sweep kills 42 mutations. It kills every specifically requested
hook: query/link edges (separately and together), selection artifact context,
all artifact reads, owners-map lookup, getModule/getInclude adapters and their
named queries, pool constants, procedural includes and cross-include consumer
attribution. The combined edge mutation fails the subclass DDIC and implicit
pool interface fixture too. Every fail-closed marker mutation is killed.
The six survivors preserve dependency linkage through another wrapped method
in this pinned core (they are redundant observations, not uncovered leaf reads):

| Surviving removed getter hook | Remaining path to the same provider owner |
| --- | --- |
| `getClassDefinition` | Calls wrapped `getMainABAPFile`, which calls wrapped `getABAPFiles`. |
| `getMainABAPFile` | Calls wrapped `getABAPFiles`. |
| `getIncludeFiles` | Calls wrapped `getIncludes` and `getABAPFiles`. |
| `getSequencedFiles` | Calls wrapped `getABAPFiles` for classes; wrapped `getMainABAPFile`/`getModules`/`getABAPFiles` for groups. |
| `getSQLViewName` | Calls wrapped DDLS `parse`, including for cached data. |
| `getDefinitionName` | Calls wrapped DDLS `parse`, including for cached data. |

Isolated cached `getDefinition`, `getIncludes`, `getModules` and
`listBadiDefinitions` reads each kill their own getter-hook mutation. A survivor
without an explicit redundancy explanation makes the sweep exit nonzero.
Scratch is removed in `finally`. The local JSON report names the failing tests
for every killed hook.

| Review item | Regression / red evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Opt-in and storage | Default/env/explicit-false test; decode persisted binary entries to check own rows plus edges and warm DDIC inheritance. Both fail on the original implementation. |
| 2. Untraced artifacts | Parse while recording, compile with recording off, reuse syntax/session with recording on; also rebuild cached DDIC off. Both fail on the original implementation; marker-removal mutations fail too. |
| 3. Retained edits | Replace/add/remove files, remove an object, and change config; assert markers and prune obsolete queries. All fail before the fix. |
| 4. Empty stack | Child with `--stack-trace-limit=0`, including iteration without owner context; originally throws. Stack-fallback/unknown-scan mutations fail. |
| 5. FM lowering | Macro-expanded CALL FUNCTION, DDIC signature chain, DOMA INT4→INT8 changes Go; original manifest lacks the lowering ownership row. Removing the new lowering query fails. |
| 6. Hook sensitivity | Consumer-owned selection, cached reads, superclass DDIC, implicit pool interface, group getters, constants/includes and unrelated-object isolation; all requested hook-removal mutations fail. |
| 7. Portable sites/CDS | External absolute frame and cwd/module paths must be scrubbed; original code and site-normalization removal fail. Folder-mode DDLS limitation documented above. |

The final combined sequential frontend/CI-oracle run passes **211 tests** in
280.6 s, including 37 provenance tests. The separately recording-enabled
CI oracle passes all six tests in 111.8 s. In each oracle run: 58 observations,
56 validated mutations, zero mismatches; the no-version negative control
still produces the required mismatches in both line modes. The changed-file
size budget, explicit-path leak scan and suite registration all exit zero.
`frontend.mjs` has zero net added lines in this fix round (the branch remains
20 lines smaller than the step-1 base). The sole default-off scalar-entry
shape failure discovered during validation was fixed and its 52-test targeted
recheck and final combined run both pass.

Three fresh-process runs per scenario, median frontend milliseconds,
Node 26.9.0, pinned libraries from `libs.lock.json`:

| Corpus | Scenario | Recording off | Recording on | Overhead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| open-abap-core + ajson | No cache | 1,448.1 ms | 1,748.4 ms | +20.7% |
| open-abap-core + ajson | cacheDir cold | 1,697.1 ms | 2,096.2 ms | +23.5% |
| open-abap-core + ajson | cacheDir warm | 1,513.0 ms | 1,859.1 ms | +22.9% |
| Oracle 300 + fixtures | No cache | 301.4 ms | 367.3 ms | +21.8% |
| Oracle 300 + fixtures | cacheDir cold | 494.3 ms | 553.4 ms | +11.9% |
| Oracle 300 + fixtures | cacheDir warm | 359.8 ms | 414.8 ms | +15.3% |

| Corpus | Cache bytes off | Cache bytes on | Growth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| open-abap-core + ajson | 526,812 | 694,009 | +31.7% |
| Oracle 300 + fixtures | 265,987 | 301,662 | +13.4% |

All 18 runs per corpus have identical artifact/class-IR digests across recording
and cache modes. The real registry has 651 objects / 272 lowered classes with
zero diagnostics; every warm run reuses 251 classes and lowers 21. The synthetic
warm runs reuse 325 and lower one. Warm cache still costs more than no-cache
compilation on these corpora; recording remains opt-in until its consumers
and performance gates are implemented. Reports remain local as
`.local/provfix-perf-real-final.json`, `.local/provfix-perf-300-final.json`, and
`.local/provfix-mutations.json`. Benchmark cache sizes count actual file bytes, not allocated blocks;
timing covers source loading, normalization, parse, syntax and lowering, and
excludes emission and diagnostic closure expansion. Warm children follow cold
primes in a separate process. Each mode's on/off emitted artifacts and class IR
must have the same SHA-256 digest. No library checkout is edited.

The real corpus still exposes unknown registry orchestration scans: supplied
parameter discovery, local class/interface collection, selected groups and
class dispatch, lock construction (twice), RTTI, table metadata and source
ownership. With cacheDir, disk-session preparation, cache inventory and session
finalization add three further unclassified sites. These rows remain global
and conservatively appear in all manifests. No claim of selective invalidation
or permission to remove the global guard follows from these results.

## Oracle

`tools/gogen/cache-oracle.mjs` exports corpus generation, mutation application,
fresh-child capture, comparison and orchestration functions, and provides a CLI.
The default seed is 719, with 300 generated control classes, split between
disconnected classes and a seeded DAG. Additional fixtures cover inheritance,
interfaces/aliases, exception hierarchies and CATCH, events, constants/defaults,
explicit and implicit type-pool consumers, class/INCLUDE macros, TABL/DTEL/DOMA
typing and SELECT, and a function module whose name differs from its FUGR.
Macro-call markers are retained refusals alongside their lowered expansion.
Pool constants cannot currently lower: `variable()` in `frontend.mjs` resolves
locals, parameters and class attributes, but not pool constants. Both explicit
and implicit constant consumers are present; their unchanged refusal makes
`pool-constant` unsupported, excluded from the validated mutation count.

For every scenario the harness copies the corpus to scratch, primes the cache in
a fresh child, edits the copy, compiles warm in another fresh child, and compiles
without cache in a third. Each child has a fresh registry. It compares UTF-8 bytes
of Go, JS (or its emitter refusal), broken/skipped/partial/diagnostics/missing, and
final RTTI/table/lock/exception/CDS/AMC/interface metadata. It repeats with
`GOGEN_NOLINE` unset and set. A no-edit control asserts that **every feature
fixture** reuses, except
`ZCL_FUNCTION` (CALL FUNCTION reads a `functionModules` descriptor containing
circular registry/syntax graphs, so recording cannot fingerprint that input) and `ZORACLE_GROUP` (function-group IR is rebuilt
outside the class cache). The unchanged real corpus may have additional
uncacheable library classes; these are reported in counts, not claimed as
feature coverage. Reorder cases
use the supplied-registry API to change only the order of files within an object.

All mutation kinds run individually, followed by a body/pool/INCLUDE multi-edit
sequence and a return to the original corpus. Reports contain the seed, full edit
descriptors, selected real classes and pins, first differing artifact and byte
offset, and `loweredClasses`/`reusedClasses` counts. Each result is saved as it
finishes. `mutationAttempts` includes unsupported attempts; `mutationsRun`
excludes `pool-constant`. Every row compares its cold artifacts with the previous
cold capture (a separate cache-disabled baseline for the first step), and throws
on a dead mutation unless it is in the explicit expected-no-change list below.
Signature/remove/rename additionally require the stable `ZCL_CONTROL_READER`
reverse dependent's cold lowering to change; add-object requires the same for
`ZCL_ABSENT_READER`. The control target is always `ZCL_CONTROL_0001`, with a
reverse dependent at every allowed corpus size. The superclass parents declare
`shared` as `i` versus `int8`, read by the grandchild; defaults have a caller
that omits the argument.

The missing-provider fixture starts with `ZCL_ADDED` absent, then adds it. The
oracle supplies a registry whose error namespace excludes only that name,
modeling an external provider: abaplint leaves it unresolved so gogen records a
lookup miss and a cached refusal instead of excluding the consumer at syntax
checking. Every other name remains syntax-checked. The CLI exits 1 on a mismatch and throws on capture/infrastructure errors.
Scratch copies and caches are removed in `finally`; reports remain at the chosen
destination.

```

`--real` copies both complete pinned `open-abap-core/src` and `ajson/src` trees
through `libraryPath`, selects every real class, and adds real-source comment and
constant mutations. It uses the real exception root instead of the synthetic
stand-in. It never edits library checkouts. Tolerant compilation compares the
real corpus's refusals as well as successfully lowered methods. This oracle
measures emission equality, not runtime ABAP semantics or incremental parser
correctness. `typing-proof.mjs` was unavailable on the Step 1 base; the capture
module uses the same fresh-process, byte-comparison pattern described in its
review, without importing an absent file.

The cache and replay instrumentation read `GOGEN_CACHE_ORACLE_FAULT`. Its exact accepted values are
**test-only**:

- `no-version`: omit registry sources from the version digest.
- `drop:<regex>`: do the same, and remove object keys matching that JavaScript
  regular expression from word-graph dependency edges and recorded `getObject`
  reads, including misses. Keys use uppercase `TYPE NAME`; the regex has no
  flags. The owner's own source hash and replay checks remain intact.
- `fingerprint-location-only`: restore the old location-only definition
  fingerprint. It may be combined with `no-version` as
  `no-version,fingerprint-location-only` to expose the borrowed-definition seam.
- `sorted-files`: retain the global guard but restore the old sorted-by-filename
  object hash, hiding within-object file-order edits.

Unknown values or invalid regular expressions throw. No other environment
variable enables these faults. Normal builds must leave this variable unset.
The CI negative control still requires the implicit pool mutation to mismatch
under `no-version` in both line modes.

### Cold observability exceptions

The explicit expected-no-change list is `pool-constant` (unsupported operand,
unchanged refusal), plus `comment-only` and `whitespace` **only with
GOGEN_NOLINE enabled** (only emitted source lines change). With lines enabled,
those text edits must change cold output. All other kinds, including FUGR,
revert and real-corpus edits, must change a cold artifact. Cold observability
alone does not establish stale-reuse sensitivity.

### Sensitivity matrix (seed 719, four controls, both line modes)

Every generated kind runs under its dedicated fault, even the uncovered ones.
A covered row must produce at least one warm/cold **MISMATCH** for that kind;
a zero-mismatch row without a documented reason fails the matrix. The CLI and
local test enforce this rule. Each report saves the fault, both observations,
cold changes, reuse lists, all differing artifacts and class IR, first byte
offset and runtime. The matrix names that evidence for every covered row.
The full matrix is a slower local mode; ordinary CI runs the normal oracle and the focused
`no-version` negative control under the three-minute oracle budget.

| Kind | Fault | MISMATCH | Coverage / reason if not covered | Differing warm/cold artifacts; class IR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| comment-only | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_CONTROL_0001$` | no | Not covered: only owner's lines change; call consumers do not inline provider text. Owner hash stays guarded. | None |
| whitespace | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_CONTROL_0001$` | no | Not covered: same source-line-only behavior. | None |
| method-body | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_CONTROL_0001$` | no | Not covered: calls do not inline bodies; owner's source hash forces lowering. | None |
| signature | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_CONTROL_0001$` | yes | Covered; dependent cold lowering changes. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_CONTROL_0003`, `ZCL_CONTROL_READER` |
| class-constant | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_DEFAULTS$` | yes | Covered; external constant consumer reuses stale value. | `emitGo`, `emitJs` |
| parameter-default | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_DEFAULTS$` | yes | Covered; caller omits argument. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_DEFAULT_READER` |
| superclass | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_(PARENT\|CHILD)` | yes | Covered; grandchild reads inherited storage with a different type. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_GRANDCHILD` |
| exception-superclass | `drop:^CLAS ZCX_` | no | Not covered: `ZCL_CATCH` is reused with identical IR; CATCH checks the hierarchy at runtime. Only edited `ZCX_LEAF` IR and `exceptionSupers` (rebuilt outside replay) change. | None |
| interface | `drop:^INTF` | yes | Covered. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_INTERFACE` |
| alias | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_INTERFACE$` | no | Not covered: used alias disappears, making edited class syntax-broken before replay. | None |
| event | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_EVENTS$` | no | Not covered: declaration and consumers share an owner, whose hash invalidates. | None |
| add-object | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_ADDED$` | yes | Covered: dropped recorded miss leaves cached absent-provider refusal. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`, `partial`; `ZCL_ABSENT_READER` |
| remove-object | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_CONTROL_0001$` | no | Not covered: dependent becomes syntax-broken before replay; dependent cold output does change. | None |
| rename | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_CONTROL_0001$` | no | Not covered: same syntax exclusion as removal. | None |
| ddic-field | `drop:^(TABL\|DTEL\|DOMA)` | yes | Covered. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`, `tables`; `ZCL_DDIC` |
| ddic-type | `drop:^(TABL\|DTEL\|DOMA)` | yes | Covered for stale successful lowering versus unsupported INT8 SELECT refusal. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`, `partial`; `ZCL_DDIC` |
| ddic-key | `drop:^(TABL\|DTEL\|DOMA)` | no | Cold coverage via final metadata: adds VALUE to the key while retaining ID. `ZCL_DDIC.RUN` lowers with identical class IR; `tables` and its Go emission change. Not covered for stale reuse: final metadata is rebuilt outside replay. | None |
| ddic-data-element | `drop:^(TABL\|DTEL\|DOMA)` | yes | Covered: switches from a domain reference to built-in CHAR(10), clears REFKIND; warm and cold `ZCL_DDIC.RUN` must still lower without refusals. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_DDIC` |
| class-macro | `drop:^CLAS ZCL_LOCAL_MACRO$` | no | Not covered: reader owns macro, so owner hash invalidates. | None |
| include-macro | `drop:^PROG` | yes | Covered: provider lives in another object. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_INCLUDE_MACRO` |
| pool-type | `drop:^TYPE` | yes | Covered: explicit and implicit consumers lower. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_POOL_EXPLICIT`, `ZCL_POOL_IMPLICIT` |
| pool-constant | `drop:^TYPE` | no | Not covered / unsupported: neither explicit nor implicit constant operand lowers. | None |
| fugr-signature | `drop:^FUGR` | no | Not covered: caller never caches because its functionModules input contains circular registry/syntax graphs that cannot be fingerprinted; group lowering is outside class replay. | None |
| same-object-local-definition | `no-version` | no | Not covered: reader owns definition, so its object hash invalidates even without global guard. | None |
| cross-object-same-position-definition | `no-version,fingerprint-location-only` | yes | Covered at the controlled replay seam with a real global definition; strengthened fingerprints stay EQUAL under `no-version`. No cross-pool local borrowing path exists. | `borrowedDefinitionReplay` |
| global-definition-passes | `drop:^INTF ZIF_PASS_` | yes | Covered: eight global interface type passes; terminal resolved type changes unchanged reader lowering. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_PASS_READER` |
| file-order | `sorted-files` | yes | Covered; first-wins macro expansion changes. | `emitGo`, `emitJs`; `ZCL_ORDER_MACRO` |

The former `same-position-definition` case is now truthfully titled
`same-object-local-definition`, including its regression test. It changes local
constant contents at identical filename/name/start coordinates, and verifies
invalidation both with the global guard and under `no-version`. This establishes
owner-source invalidation only. A cross-object borrowed local-definition
fixture has not been established: frontend local definitions are qualified as
`OWNER:LOCAL` and ABAP local names resolve in their owning class pool. Global
named definitions get ordinary source-word/getObject dependencies. Step 3 covers the fingerprint invariant at the controlled global-definition
replay seam described above; the unavailable cross-pool local path remains
explicitly outside that claim.

### Round-one measurements (historical)

Local Node runs, seed 719, both line modes. The full oracle and matrix shared
machine capacity; timings include fresh process startup and disk identity work.

| Run | Attempts / validated | Result | Runtime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CI: eight controls, multi-edit/revert, all kinds | 58 / 56 | Zero mismatches; edits reuse zero classes; unchanged/revert reuse 33 classes per line mode. | 122 s |
| Full: 300 controls + pinned open-abap-core/ajson | 62 / 60 | Zero mismatches; edits reuse zero; unchanged/revert reuse 575 classes and lower 22 per line mode. | 635 s |
| CLI sensitivity: four controls, all 25 kinds | 50 / 48 | 13 covered kinds, 26 mismatches; 12 explicitly not covered. | 201 s |
| Focused no-version negative control | Two pool-type observations | Two mismatches, including cached implicit consumer. | 5.8 s |

The final combined check passed all 47 tests in 164 s, including the separate
local matrix suite (164 s). The size budget, leak scan and suite registration
checks also passed.

The full run lowered 35,854 classes across mutation observations and reused
1,150 (the two reverts). Unsupported pool-constant attempts are the difference
between attempted and validated counts. The complete kind/fault/results matrix
and reasons are above; JSON reports remain local under `.local/`.

### Round-two measurements

Seed 719, both line modes. The revised 25-kind sensitivity matrix has 12 covered
kinds / 24 mismatches and 13 explicitly not covered kinds (149 s). The valid
key edit changes final metadata but cannot expose stale class reuse. The
exception row confirms catcher reuse and identical catcher IR, rather than
replay rejection. Reports now name every differing artifact and class IR;
the table above records this evidence even when emitted output changes without
class IR changes (the external constant case).

The separate local sensitivity test also passes in 150 s.
All 47 focused tests pass in 115 s, including the normal CI oracle (58 attempts,
56 validated, zero mismatches, 108 s) and the no-version negative control
(two mismatches). The DDIC assertions reject absent/dropped RUN and any
ZCL_DDIC broken/skipped/partial refusal; baseline, warm and cold must all pass.

The full 300-control plus pinned open-abap-core/ajson oracle passes all
62 attempts / 60 validated observations with zero mismatches in
534.8 s. Edits reuse zero classes; each revert reuses 575 and lowers 22.
Across mutation observations it lowers 35,854 classes and reuses
1,150. Size-budget and changed-file leak checks pass.

## Why the global guard remains

The [local design review's numbered plan](../.local/codex-queue/cachekey.log)
and coverage tables identify these unresolved paths. That log is local review
material and is not distributed in a clean checkout.

| Gap | Why words and lowering-time reads do not suffice |
| --- | --- |
| Implicit type pools | `POOL_TYPE` need not name the `POOL` object as a word; resolved signatures can precede recording. |
| Sibling/parent INCLUDE macros | Macro discovery follows filenames and including contexts; resolution can happen before lowering. |
| FUGR scans | Function-module names differ from group names; ownership resolution scans groups without `getObject`. |
| CDS aliases | SQL-view aliases are resolved by scanning DDLS providers. |
| BAdI definitions | ENHS/BAdI lookup is a type-wide scan and can affect syntax acceptance before gogen refuses a statement. |
| Definition fingerprints | Step 3 now guards the owner's semantic digest alongside location; controlled cross-object global-definition replay coverage is established. Normal cross-pool local borrowing remains unavailable. This alone does not cover incomplete provenance. |

Cached DDIC types/scopes can also hide earlier reads, and global OO resolution
passes make stopping/order behavior a semantic input. Passing mutation tests
does not prove that an incomplete dependency manifest is safe.

## Six-step plan

1. **Regressions and oracle, with global invalidation.** This change: implicit
   pools, same-object local definitions, file order, compiler identity, every mutation
   category, and the existing cache/replay/portability gates. Retained-registry
   parser invalidation is outside this step; all edited captures rebuild registries.
2. **Semantic provenance and resolution queries before parsing.** Implemented: attribute
   named lookups, misses, filename/alias/scan resolution and cached-artifact reads
   to their owners. Unknown paths fail closed.
3. **Resolved-artifact digests and stronger definition fingerprints.** Implemented:
   resolved semantic snapshots, location plus owner digest, dependency digest
   metadata and inspection; global resolution/order and replay sensitivity gates.
4. **Per-entry schema-v3 keys for complete manifests.** Keep global guards for
   incomplete entries. Require the fresh-process oracle and exact control reuse
   assertions (for example, ten dependent classes lower while 290 others reuse).
5. **Bounded real-corpus and performance gates.** Compare unchanged/edited warm,
   cold and recording costs; require zero byte mismatches and measured benefit.
6. **Incremental parser invalidation and dependency precision separately.**
   Test retained registries against fresh cold after multi-edit/inventory/config
   sequences; narrow body/interface hashes only after dedicated cases pass.

Step 4a.1 query scoping and registry rebuilding and Step 4a.2 shadow keys are
implemented. The recorder-time budget remains unmet and its cacheDir-only cost
is provisionally accepted for this shadow step. Step 4b flagged selective lookup
and Step 4c default selective lookup remain plans. Production still performs no
selective reuse across registry versions.

Step 4b.1 adds the [global-first fast path](gogen-cache-global-first.md): ordinary
compilation probes v3 only after exact global/replay misses. Exhaustive shadow
validation remains available for the oracle. The global certificate now also
covers dependency roles and Node/V8 identity; both tool-identity variants share
actual source/build hashing.


## Runner opt-in (step 4b)

`OSD_GOGEN_CACHE=1` (or an explicit directory) enables the per-class cache in
`osd run` / osabap and Go ABAP Unit rebuilds. It stays off by default. The runner
can replay complete, revalidated dependency-closure candidates after a global
miss; ordinary cacheDir callers retain the global lookup. Unchanged runner inputs
avoid repeating provenance recording without weakening the content/replay guards.
See [runner diagnosis, proof and phase measurements](gogen-cache-runners.md).
